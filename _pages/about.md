I am a PhD student at the Tri-Institutional Computational Biology
and Medicine program. I was previously an undergraduate student in data science
and general biology at UC San Diego and a researcher in Graham McVicker's lab
at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. My research interests include gene
regulation, statistical genetics, single-cell genomics, and CRISPR. For fun, I
enjoy playing tennis, running, strumming the guitar, and watching football and
basketball.
